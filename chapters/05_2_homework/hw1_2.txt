# Exercise 1.9 – Variable Names
The Python interpreter has strict rules for variable names. Which of the following are legal Python names? If the name is not legal, state the reason.  If you're not sure, try it in the interactive python interpreter.

1. and
invalid syntax
2. _and
legal
3. var
legal
4. var1
legal
5. 1var
SyntaxError: invalid decimal literal
6. my-name
SyntaxError: cannot assign to expression here.
7. your_name
legal
8. COLOR
legal

# Exercise 1.10 – Types
It is important that we know the type of the values stored in a variable so that we can use the correct operators (as we have already seen!). Python automatically infers the type from the value you assign to the variable. Write down the type of the values stored in each of the variables below. Pay special attention to punctuation: values are not always the type they seem!

1. a = False
bool
2. b=3.7
float
3. c = ’Alex’
string
4. d = 7
integer
5. e = ’True’
string
6. f = 17
int
7. g = ’17’
string
8. h = True
bool
9. i = ’3.14159’
string

To verify your answers, you can use the interactive Python shell, but first try to do the exercise without help.
>>> x = 100
>>> type(x)
<type ’int’>
>>>

# Exercise 1.11 – Natural Language Processing
Consider the following sentence:
Alice saw the boy on the hill with the telescope.

1. What is unclear about this sentence?
I don't know if Alice has the telescope or the boy has the telescope.

2. Write the sentence in two different ways, that clarifies both possible meanings of the sentence (hint: rewrite the sentence using extra words, commas, etc).
- With the telescope, Alice saw the boy on the hill.
- Alice saw a boy who had a telescope on the hill.

3. The ambiguity illustrated by this sentence is known as “prepositional phrase attachment.” Think about this as you continue to learn how to program, and consider how programming languages are designed to avoid the ambiguity illustrated by this example!

# Exercise 1.12 – Boolean operators
Boolean operators can seem tricky at first, and it takes practice to evaluate them correctly. Write the value (True
or False) produced by each expession below, using the assigned values of the variables a, b, and c. Try to do this
without using your interpreter, but you should check yourself when you think you’ve got it. Hint: Work from the
inside out, starting with the inner-most expressions, like in arithmetic.

    a = False
    b = True
    c = False

1. b and c
True and False
False

2. b or c
True or False
True

3. not a and b
not (False) and (True)
True and True
True

4. (a and b) or not c
((False) and (True)) or not (False)
(False) or True
True

5. not b and not (a or c)
not (True) and not (False or False)
False and not (False)
False and True
False

# Exercise 1.13 – Conditionals
The purpose of this exercise is to understand conditionals. Tiberius is looking for his dream job, but has some
restrictions. He loves California and would take a job there if it paid over 40,000 a year. He hates Massachusetts
and demands at least 100,000 to work there. Any other place he’s content to work for 60,000 a year, unless he can
work in space in which case he would work for free. The following code shows his basic strategy for evaluating a
job offer.

pay = _____
location = _____

if location == "U.S.S. Enterprise":"
    print "So long, suckers! I’ll take it!"
elif location == "Massachusetts":
    if pay < 100000:
        print "No way"
    else:
        print "I’ll take it!"
elif location == "California" and pay > 40000:
    print "I’ll take it!"
elif pay > 60000:
    print "I’ll take it!"
else:
    print "No thanks, I can find something better."

For each of the following job offers, write down the output that would be generated. Do this without running the
code. It is an important skill to be able to understand what a piece of code does without running it.

1. location = "Massachusetts", pay = 50000
No way

2. location = "Iowa", pay = 50000
No thanks, I can find something better.

3. location = "California", pay = 50000
I'll take it!

4. location = "U.S.S. Enterprise", pay = 1
So long, suckers!  I'll take it!

5. location = "California", pay = 25000
No thanks, I can find something better.
